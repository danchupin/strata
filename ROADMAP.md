# Strata roadmap

MVP (phases 0–8) is complete. The "modern complete" Ralph cycle (US-001..US-049 on
`ralph/modern-complete`) closed the bulk of the original P1/P2/P3 backlog: SSE-S3 + SSE-KMS,
notifications, replicator, access-log delivery, structured logs, full Prometheus + Grafana,
health probes, virtual-hosted URLs, audit log + export, per-part GET, versioning null literal,
website redirects, OTel tracing through Cassandra and RADOS, admin CLI, race harness, Inventory,
Access Points, ScyllaDB CI, multi-cluster RADOS, online shard resize, examples, protobuf manifest.

Next phase is **consolidation and validation**, not feature breadth. Items below are labeled
as before:
- **P1** — correctness or production-blockers
- **P2** — meaningful gaps; expected for serious deployments
- **P3** — nice-to-have, visibility, DX

S3-compatibility headline: **92.7% (165/178)** on the executable subset of `ceph/s3-tests`. See
`scripts/s3-tests/README.md` for the gap breakdown.

---

## Consolidation & validation (the new top of the stack)

These are not feature work. The codebase shipped a lot of surface in a short window; before
adding more, prove what is there.

- ~~**P1 — Single-binary `strata` (CockroachDB-shape).**~~ — **Done.** Two binaries
  (`strata`, `strata-admin`); `strata server` runs the gateway plus an opt-in subset of
  workers (gc, lifecycle, notify, replicator, access-log, inventory, audit-export,
  manifest-rewriter) selected via `STRATA_WORKERS=`. Each worker keeps its own
  `internal/leader` lease keyed on `<name>-leader`. SSE master-key rotation moved to
  `strata-admin rewrap`. One Docker image, one compose service. (commit `ae4e338`)
- ~~**P1 — Race harness as a real test, not a gate.**~~ — **Done.** Carved
  out `internal/racetest`, shipped `cmd/strata-racecheck` standalone binary,
  extended the workload to multipart + versioning + conditional + DeleteObjects
  with read-after-write + listing-convergence + version-monotonicity oracles,
  added the memory-tuned `ci`-profile compose stack (`make up-all-ci`),
  wired `make race-soak` + `scripts/racecheck/{run,summarize}.sh`, and
  scheduled `.github/workflows/race-nightly.yml` (03:00 UTC, ubuntu-latest,
  90 min budget). Zero-inconsistency baseline recorded at
  `docs/racecheck/baseline-2026-05.md`. (commit `3c04a05`)
- ~~**P1 — s3-tests 80% → 90%+.**~~ — **Done.** Lifted to **91.5% (162/177)** by the
  `ralph/s3-compat-95` cycle (US-001..US-006 — multipart copy range-parser + special-char
  URL handling, ?partNumber=N GET wire shape flipped to whole-object multipart ETag,
  CRC32 / CRC32C / CRC64NVME `FULL_OBJECT` composite combine math, multipart Complete
  `If-Match`-on-missing-object → 404 NoSuchKey AWS-parity, suspended-bucket GET
  stale-row dual-probe, missing-bucket DELETE → 404 ahead of auth, ListObjectVersions
  Owner DisplayName, validate-then-flip on Complete in cassandra+memory). The 4
  follow-up real failures filed as separate P2 entries below were closed by
  `ralph/s3-compat-finish` (US-001..US-003), lifting the headline to 92.7%
  (165/178). See `scripts/s3-tests/README.md` for the per-test gap breakdown.
  (commit `494b62b`)
- **P2 — Benchmarks vs RGW.** "Drop-in RGW replacement" is unproven without numbers. Run
  `warp` and `cosbench` against both gateways on the same RADOS cluster. Publish absolute
  latency / throughput per workload class (small-object PUT, large-object GET, listing,
  multipart) in a dedicated `docs/site/content/architecture/benchmarks/` directory. Update on each release.
- **P2 — ScyllaDB benchmarks.** `docs/site/content/architecture/backends/scylla.md` (US-042) documents the path; the
  expected 3–5× LWT speedup on Paxos hot paths (bucket-create, versioning-flip,
  multipart-complete) needs measurement. Same harness as the RGW benches, swap the
  metadata backend.
- ~~**P3 — Drop unused background daemons.**~~ — **Done.** Default compose stack
  is `cassandra + ceph + strata` (gateway + gc + lifecycle); the feature workers
  (notify / replicator / access-log / inventory / audit-export) live behind a
  single `--profile features` `strata-features` replica. (commit `5841043`)
- ~~**P1 — TiKV first-class metadata backend.**~~ — **Done.** `internal/meta/tikv`
  implements the full `meta.Store` surface; native ordered range scans via the
  optional `meta.RangeScanStore` interface short-circuit Cassandra's 64-way
  fan-out on `ListObjects` (~5× faster on a 100k-object bucket per
  `docs/site/content/architecture/benchmarks/meta-backend-comparison.md`). Wired through
  `STRATA_META_BACKEND=tikv` + `STRATA_TIKV_PD_ENDPOINTS`; ships with
  `--profile tikv` in compose, `make up-tikv` / `make smoke-tikv`,
  `.github/workflows/ci-tikv.yml`, race-soak coverage, contract suite parity,
  and `docs/site/content/architecture/backends/tikv.md`. Memory is now tests-only; the previously listed
  community backends (FoundationDB, PostgreSQL+Citus / Yugabyte) are dropped
  from the roadmap. (commit `40b45de`)

## Correctness & consistency

- **P2 — `deregister_ready` ignores GC queue + open multipart — operator can leak chunks on env-edit deregister.** Current logic in `internal/adminapi/clusters_drain_progress.go::197` computes `deregReady := total == 0` where `total = manifest scan count of chunks with BackendRef.Cluster == drained-id`. This is INSUFFICIENT: when rebalance worker just moved chunks A→B, the manifest CAS updates first, then OLD (A, oid) is enqueued for GC. Between manifest CAS and gc worker tick + `STRATA_GC_GRACE` expiry, the manifest scan reports 0 but the physical RADOS pool on A still holds the chunks. Operator sees "✓ Ready to deregister" → edits `STRATA_RADOS_CLUSTERS` env removing A + rolling restart → gc worker can no longer dial A → entries stay in GC queue forever → orphan chunks in A's pool permanently. Same problem if open multipart sessions still hold a handle on A — Complete fires after dereg → 5xx storm. Fix scope: extend `deregister_ready` to AND three conditions: (1) `manifest_count == 0` (existing), (2) `gc_queue_pending_for_cluster == 0` (new — adds `meta.Store.ListChunkDeletionsByCluster` probe), (3) `no_open_multipart_on_cluster` (new — adds `meta.Store.ListMultipartUploadsByCluster` probe). When any fails → response carries new `not_ready_reasons []string` array so UI can render specific blocker. Surfaced inline in drain-cleanup cycle as US-006 (bundled with drawer + cache fixes).
- **P2 — UI state-aware action buttons missing — operator can undrain fully-evacuated cluster accidentally.** ClustersSubsection.tsx cluster card renders "Undrain" button unconditionally in evacuating mode — regardless of how many chunks remain. After full migration (chunks=0, deregister_ready=true), operator can click Undrain → state flips back to live → cluster receives writes again, reverting hours of migration work. Worse: no confirm dialog explaining "moved chunks stay on target clusters — no rollback". Fix scope: button visibility derived from (state, chunks, deregister_ready) truth table — `evacuating + chunks=0 + deregister_ready=true` → "Undrain" replaced by "Cancel deregister prep" with typed-confirm modal (mirrors ConfirmDrainModal). When `gc_pending` blocks deregister_ready → Undrain disabled with tooltip "Cannot undrain while GC queue is processing". Surfaced inline in drain-cleanup cycle as US-007.
- **P2 — `/drain-impact` cache not invalidated on bucket placement PUT — bulk-fix workflow blocked for 5 minutes.** `internal/adminapi/clusters_drain_impact.go:21` sets `drainImpactCacheTTL = 5 * time.Minute`. Bucket placement PUT handler does NOT invalidate this cache. Result: operator runs `<BulkPlacementFixDialog>` Apply → policies updated correctly in meta → `<ConfirmDrainModal>` refetches `/drain-impact` → cache returns STALE categorization → stuck count unchanged → Submit stays blocked. Operator must wait the full 5-minute TTL before retry succeeds. Real user-blocking bug: documented workflow ("Fix N buckets → retry Drain") doesn't actually work within reasonable time. Fix scope: PUT `/admin/v1/buckets/{name}/placement` + DELETE handler must call `cache.Invalidate(<every-cluster-in-old-and-new-policy>)` synchronously before returning 200. Simpler: invalidate ALL cluster entries (cheap — recomputed on next /drain-impact request, operator-driven cost). Add integration test: bulk-fix workflow completes end-to-end within one HTTP round-trip after Apply (no 5-min wait). ~1 story.
- **P2 — `<BucketReferencesDrawer>` shows only Placement-referencing buckets, not all chunks-on-cluster.** Operator clicks "Show affected buckets" on a cluster card and sees "No buckets reference this cluster in their Placement policy. Default routing buckets are not listed — drain only stops new chunk writes for buckets that explicitly target this cluster" even when the cluster has chunks from nil-policy buckets (class-env routing OR default-routing via cluster.weight). This is a **regression** the `ralph/drain-transparency` cycle should have caught: US-004 redesigned `<ConfirmDrainModal>` to fetch `/drain-impact` (which surfaces ALL chunks-on-cluster categorized), but `<BucketReferencesDrawer>` was forgotten and still uses the old `/bucket-references` endpoint that filters by `Placement[<cluster>] > 0`. Walkthrough exercise pre-cycle listed the drawer in step 3 but didn't verify the underlying fetch was migrated. Fix scope: rewrite `<BucketReferencesDrawer>` to use `/drain-impact` data — render the 3-category breakdown (migratable / stuck_single_policy / stuck_no_policy) with per-bucket suggested_policies + inline "Bulk fix" button that opens the existing `<BulkPlacementFixDialog>`. Empty-state message only when `total_chunks=0`. Drop the legacy `/bucket-references` endpoint OR keep as a thin convenience layer over /drain-impact. ~1-2 stories. Process note: future cycles must run the walkthrough exercise against ACTUAL UI components, not just acceptance criteria checkboxes.
- **P3 — Storage page Pools column "Objects" ambiguous (RADOS chunks vs S3 objects).** `data.PoolStatus.ObjectCount` field carries RADOS object count (one per chunk — a 5 MiB S3 object splits into 2 × 4 MiB chunks → 2 RADOS objects). Storage page renders this as "Objects" column header which collides with the BucketDetail "Objects" column that shows S3 object count. Operator uploads one file, sees Storage page report "2 objects" → confused. Fix scope: (a) rename Pools column header "Objects" → "Chunks" (or "Backend objects") in `web/src/pages/Storage.tsx` Pools table; (b) add `<Tooltip>` on the header explaining "RADOS chunk count — large S3 objects span multiple 4 MiB chunks; for S3 object count see BucketDetail"; (c) rename JSON field `object_count` → `chunk_count` on `PoolStatus` wire shape (breaking JSON change, but per CLAUDE.md no prod deploys); (d) update OpenAPI spec + memory + RADOS + S3 backends + tests. ~1 story.

- ~~**P2 — Default-routing weights + `pending` cluster state (safe gradual cluster activation).**~~ — **Done.** `ralph/cluster-weights` (US-001..US-005) shipped the 5th state `pending` + per-cluster `weight int (0..100)` field, boot-time reconcile that auto-inits new env clusters to `pending`/`0` (or `live`/`100` when `bucket_stats` already references them), `placement.DefaultPolicy` synthesised default routing, admin endpoints `POST /clusters/{id}/activate` + `PUT /clusters/{id}/weight` with audit + 409 transitions, `<ActivateClusterModal>` (typed-confirm + initial-weight slider) and `<LiveClusterWeightSlider>` (debounced PUT + weight=0 chip + 4xx revert), e2e Playwright spec + `make smoke-cluster-weights` four-scenario harness, and the `docs/site/content/best-practices/placement-rebalance.md` Cluster lifecycle section. Two-weight-layer rule enforced: bucket `Placement` always wins over cluster `weight`. (commit `5bd997c`)
- **P2 — `POST /admin/v1/buckets/{name}/force-empty` leaks chunks in storage backend.** `internal/adminapi/buckets_delete.go::forceEmptyDrainPage` calls `s.Meta.DeleteObject(...)` per row but does NOT enqueue the returned `*meta.Object.Manifest.Chunks` into the GC queue. Meta rows + bucket_stats counters get cleaned, but the underlying RADOS / S3 chunks remain in the pool / bucket forever — no GC worker picks them up. Compare to the S3 DeleteObject path (`internal/s3api/server.go::deleteObject`) which explicitly calls `s.enqueueChunks(ctx, o.Manifest.Chunks)` after a successful `Meta.DeleteObject`. The admin path is missing that call. Severity: operator running "Force delete" on a 10 TiB bucket leaks 10 TiB of orphan RADOS objects. Fix scope: extract the enqueue helper into a place reachable from both admin + s3api packages (or inject the s3api enqueue function into `adminapi.Config`); add unit test that asserts chunks get enqueued after force-empty; integration test on the multi-cluster lab verifies `rados ls` count drops to 0 after force-empty completes.

- ~~**P2 — Multipart copy edges (UploadPartCopy).**~~ — **Done.** US-001 closed the
  copy-source-range parser (`internal/s3api/multipart.go::parseCopySourceRangeStrict`
  splits 400 InvalidArgument syntax errors from 416 InvalidRange out-of-bounds) and
  the special-char URL handling (`copy_object.go::parseCopySource` splits on `?`
  before `url.PathUnescape` so literal `?` in keys round-trips). `_improper_range`
  passes. The `_small` / `_special_names` / `_multiple_sizes` tests still fail on a
  separate axis (GET-side checksum echo on the destination — see new entry below).
  (commit `968a32a`)

- ~~**P2 — Multipart copy GET-side checksum echo divergence.**~~ — **Done.**
  Root-caused via `ralph/s3-compat-finish` baseline rerun: the failure was NOT
  destination-side checksum recompute drift but a Range-GET echo bug on the
  source object. boto3 1.36+ default-on FlexibleChecksum auto-sets
  `x-amz-checksum-mode: ENABLED` on every GET, the test's `_check_key_content`
  issues a `bytes=0-N` Range GET on the source, server emitted the
  whole-object `x-amz-checksum-*` (a stored digest covering every byte) and
  boto3 validated it against the partial response body — guaranteed mismatch.
  AWS suppresses checksum echo on Range responses; Strata now does the same
  in `internal/s3api/server.go::getObject`. US-001 (CRC64NVME / CRC32 / CRC32C
  empty-type → FULL_OBJECT default at multipart Initiate) and US-003 (Range-GET
  suppression) together flip all three tests
  (`test_multipart_copy_small`, `_special_names`, `_multiple_sizes`) green.
  (commit `d8aa9fa`)

- ~~**P2 — `?partNumber=N` GET quoted-ETag wire shape.**~~ — **Done.** US-002
  flipped the wire shape: `?partNumber=N` GET / HEAD now echoes the WHOLE-OBJECT
  multipart ETag (`"<32hex>-<count>"`), matching `complete_multipart_upload`'s
  response — not the per-part ETag. Out-of-range `partNumber` returns
  `400 InvalidPart` (was 416 InvalidRange). Non-multipart `?partNumber=1` returns
  the whole object 200 OK; `?partNumber=N` for N≥2 returns 400 InvalidPart. Three
  s3-tests pass: `test_multipart_get_part`, `_sse_c_get_part`, `_single_get_part`.
  (commit `6b4e304`)

- ~~**P2 — Multipart composite checksum CRC32 / CRC32C / CRC64NVME.**~~ — **Done.**
  US-003 added the AWS `FULL_OBJECT` composite shape for the CRC family in
  `internal/s3api/checksum.go::combineCRCParts` — standard zlib `crc32_combine` /
  `crc64_combine` math (gf2 matrix square+times) over per-part (CRC, size) yields
  the whole-stream CRC. SHA1 / SHA256 stay COMPOSITE (`BASE64(HASH(concat(raw_i)))-N`).
  Three s3-tests pass: `test_multipart_use_cksum_helper_crc32`, `_crc32c`,
  `_crc64nvme`. (commit `798ab58`)

- ~~**P2 — Multipart `If-Match`-on-missing-object error code.**~~ — **Done.** US-004
  reverted CompleteMultipartUpload's `If-Match`-on-missing-object branch from
  RFC 7232 §3.1's `412 PreconditionFailed` to AWS S3's `404 NoSuchKey`. The
  ETag-mismatch-on-existing-object path stays `412`. `putObject`'s single-PUT path
  is unchanged (per RFC). Two s3-tests pass: `test_multipart_put_object_if_match`,
  `_put_current_object_if_match`. (commit `8b5ca84`)

- ~~**P1 — Cassandra null-version timeuuid sentinel.**~~ — **Done.** Fixed in the
  prior `ralph/s3-compat-90` cycle (cassandra-internal v1 sentinel
  `00000000-0000-1000-8000-000000000000` translated at every gocql.ParseUUID /
  .String() boundary; `internal/meta/cassandra/store.go::versionToCQL`). The
  `ralph/s3-compat-95` cycle's US-006 added the missing CI coverage:
  `internal/meta/cassandra/store_integration_test.go::TestCassandraNullSentinelOnDisk`
  asserts the on-disk `objects.version_id` is the v1 sentinel while
  `meta.NullVersionID` surfaces the canonical zero UUID to clients, plus a
  Suspended-mode INSERT step in the storetest contract `caseVersioningNullSentinel`.
  CI integration job runs `go test -v` so the test name prints, catching skip
  regressions. (commit `494b62b`)

- ~~**P1 — `koanf` env provider does not skip empty env values.**~~ — **Done.**
  Fixed in the prior `ralph/s3-compat-90` cycle (`env.Provider` →
  `env.ProviderWithValue` with an empty-skip callback;
  `internal/config/config.go::Load`). The `ralph/s3-compat-95` cycle's US-006 added
  `internal/config/config_test.go::TestLoadEmptyEnvDoesNotOverrideTOMLValue` that
  routes through `STRATA_CONFIG_FILE` (TOML default `gc.interval=30s`) +
  `STRATA_GC_INTERVAL=""` and asserts `cfg.GC.Interval == 30*time.Second`. Locks
  the empty-skip callback against future regression. (commit `494b62b`)

- ~~**P2 — Multipart Complete leaks `completing` state on per-part ETag mismatch.**~~
  — **Done.** US-005 flipped the cassandra + memory backends' `CompleteMultipartUpload`
  to validate-then-flip: ListParts + per-part ETag walk runs first, only then does
  the LWT (cassandra) / in-place mutation (memory) flip status to `completing`. A
  stale-ETag retry now leaves the upload in `uploading` and a corrected retry
  succeeds. TiKV was already correct (deferred `rollbackOnError(txn, &err)` rolls
  the flip back on validation failure). Note: `test_multipart_resend_first_finishes_last`
  still fails on a separate axis (duplicate PartNumber in Complete XML — see new
  entry below). (commit `ba9368a`)

- ~~**P2 — Multipart Complete rejects duplicate PartNumber in Parts list.**~~ — **Done.**
  `internal/s3api/multipart.go::completeMultipart` strict-ascending check
  relaxed from `<= prev` to `< prev`; on equality the previously appended
  `meta.CompletePart` is overwritten with the LAST entry's ETag (AWS take-latest
  semantics) before the per-part walk. Storage-side `meta.Store.SavePart`
  last-write-wins on all three backends, so the LAST submitted ETag resolves
  against the LATEST stored part. `[1, 3, 2]` still rejects with
  `InvalidPartOrder`. s3-test `test_multipart_resend_first_finishes_last` flips
  to PASS. (commit `d8aa9fa`)

- **P3 — Object Lock `COMPLIANCE` audit log.** `audit_log` (US-022) records all
  state-changing requests, but a denied DELETE under `COMPLIANCE` is not flagged
  distinctly. Regulated customers want a queryable "blocked retention violation" feed —
  add a typed `audit.Event.Reason` field that `audit_log` reads to filter.

## Auth

- ~~**P3 — STS / assume-role.**~~ — **Done.** Minimal AssumeRole endpoint at `?Action=AssumeRole` (`internal/s3api/sts.go` + `internal/auth/sts.go`). Issues a temporary credential triple (`STSSession{AccessKey, Secret, SessionToken}`) with `DefaultSTSDuration` validity; verifier honours `SessionToken` on subsequent SigV4 requests. (commit `cec9c06`)
- **P3 — Per-bucket request signing keys (KMS-backed).** Rotate the signing material on
  a schedule, reject keys older than `STRATA_KEY_MAX_AGE`. Hooks onto the existing
  Vault provider.

## Scalability & performance

- ~~**P1 — gc / lifecycle workers serialise inside a single goroutine; throughput cap ~50–500 ops/s.**~~ — **Done.** Phase 1 shipped via the `ralph/gc-lifecycle-scale` cycle (US-001..US-005). Bounded `errgroup` inside the elected leader (`STRATA_GC_CONCURRENCY` / `STRATA_LIFECYCLE_CONCURRENCY`, default 1, max 256) lifts per-worker throughput ~9× (gc) / ~19× (lifecycle) on the canonical lab-tikv stack. Measured on N=10000 with `STRATA_DATA_BACKEND=memory` + TiKV: gc 11108 → 100275 chunks/s (c=1 → c=256, knee at c=64 with +11 % beyond), lifecycle 485 → 9150 objects/s (c=1 → c=256, no knee inside the swept range). Recommended production default: `STRATA_GC_CONCURRENCY=64`, `STRATA_LIFECYCLE_CONCURRENCY=64` (push to 128–256 if the meta backend has headroom). Bench harness lands as `strata-admin bench-gc` + `strata-admin bench-lifecycle`; results captured in `docs/site/content/architecture/benchmarks/gc-lifecycle.md`. (commit `cc5c7fb`)
- ~~**P1 — gc / lifecycle Phase 2 — sharded leader-election.**~~ — **Done.** Shipped via the `ralph/gc-lifecycle-scale-phase-2` cycle (US-001..US-007). gc gets `gc-leader-0..N-1` per-shard leases driven by `STRATA_GC_SHARDS` (default 1, range `[1, 1024]`); each replica races for one or more leases and drains via the new `Meta.ListGCEntriesShard` API on memory + Cassandra (`gc_entries_v2` partitioned on `(region, shard_id)`) + TiKV (new `s/qG/<region>/<shardID2BE>/<oid>` prefix). Lifecycle gets per-bucket leases (`lifecycle-leader-<bucketID>`) plus a `fnv32a(bucketID) % STRATA_GC_SHARDS == myReplicaID` distribution gate so each replica owns a strict subset of buckets. Multi-leader bench (US-006) on the 3-replica `lab-tikv-3` lab confirms the expected ~3× aggregate ceiling at `STRATA_GC_SHARDS=3` / `STRATA_GC_CONCURRENCY=64` (gc ≈ 250–270k chunks/s, lifecycle ≈ 18–19.5k objects/s) — full curve in `docs/site/content/architecture/benchmarks/gc-lifecycle.md` (Phase 2 — multi-leader). Cassandra + TiKV cutover runs through `STRATA_GC_DUAL_WRITE` (default `on`); operator runbook in `docs/site/content/architecture/migrations/gc-lifecycle-phase-2.md`. Single-replica deploy at `STRATA_GC_SHARDS=1` reproduces Phase 1 behaviour byte-for-byte. (commit `3743931`)
- ~~**P2 — Dynamic RADOS / S3 cluster registry + zero-downtime add.**~~ — **Won't-do.** Design decision (2026-05-11): cluster set stays config-driven via env (`STRATA_RADOS_CLUSTERS` for RADOS; `STRATA_S3_CLUSTERS` to be added for S3). Adding a new cluster requires a gateway restart, but multi-instance deployments hide per-instance downtime — rolling restart of N replicas keeps the service available throughout. A prior attempt at the dynamic registry (`ralph/dynamic-clusters`, merged `cba53b5`, reverted `055ef26`) shipped `meta.ClusterRegistry` + admin API + RADOS watcher; rolled back because single-source-of-truth via env is simpler operationally + tests are easier when config is static. The remaining gap is the S3-backend half: today `internal/data/s3/backend.go` is single-bucket-per-instance; covered by a separate P2 entry below for env-driven multi-cluster S3.
- ~~**P2 — Env-driven multi-cluster S3 data backend.**~~ — **Done.** Shipped via the `ralph/s3-multi-cluster` cycle (US-001..US-006). `internal/data/s3/Backend` lifted to `clusters map[string]*s3Cluster` + `classes map[string]ClassSpec` with per-cluster `*awss3.Client` + `*manager.Uploader` lazy-built via `connFor`. Two new envs replace the 13 retired `STRATA_S3_BACKEND_*` envs: `STRATA_S3_CLUSTERS` (JSON array of bucket-less `S3ClusterSpec`s — endpoint / region / force_path_style / part_size / upload_concurrency / max_retries / op_timeout_secs / sse_mode / sse_kms_key_id / credentials) + `STRATA_S3_CLASSES` (JSON object mapping storage class → `{cluster, bucket}` — both REQUIRED per class). Credentials never plaintext — `CredentialsRef` discriminator (`{type:"chain"}` / `{type:"env", ref:"VAR1:VAR2"}` / `{type:"file", ref:"/path:profile"}`); `env:` + `file:` probed at boot, `chain` defers to SDK first-connect. Bucket arg routing through `resolveClass` on every data-plane method (Put / Get / Delete / Head / Copy / List / PutChunks / GetChunks / Presign / Multipart) — the multipart handle was widened to `cluster\x00bucket\x00key\x00uploadID` so Complete / Abort recover routing without re-walking the class table. Test fixture `s3test.NewFixture(t)` collapses inline per-file setup (-216 LOC across six test files). Operator guide: [S3 multi-cluster routing](docs/site/content/best-practices/s3-multi-cluster.md). Adding / removing a cluster requires gateway restart — multi-replica rolling restart hides per-instance downtime. NOT in scope: chunk-side data migration (covered by P2 'Per-bucket placement policy + cross-cluster rebalance worker' below); KMS-fetched cluster credentials (P3 follow-up). (commit `ccae6ab`)
- ~~**P2 — Per-bucket placement policy + cross-cluster rebalance worker.**~~ — **Done.** Shipped via the `ralph/placement-rebalance` cycle (US-001..US-007). Per-bucket policy lives on `meta.Bucket.Placement` (`{cluster: weight}` map, validated weight ∈ [0,100] + sum>0, JSON blob persisted via `setBucketBlob` on memory / Cassandra / TiKV); `internal/data/placement.PickCluster` routes via stable `fnv32a("<bucketID>/<key>/<chunkIdx>") % sum(weights)` walk over sorted cluster ids so the same chunk always lands on the same cluster across retries. RADOS + S3 `Backend.PutChunks` consult the policy via ctx-threaded helpers (`data.WithPlacement` / `WithObjectKey` / `WithBucketID`); legacy buckets with `Placement == nil` short-circuit to the class default — zero schema or behavior change. New `strata server --workers=rebalance` (leader-elected on `rebalance-leader`, env knobs `STRATA_REBALANCE_INTERVAL` / `_RATE_MB_S` / `_INFLIGHT` clamped + WARN-logged) walks every bucket with a policy, plans per-chunk moves whose current cluster ≠ verdict, and dispatches through a `MoverChain`: RADOS mover (`Read(srcIoctx) → Write(tgtIoctx, fresh OID)`) and S3 mover (`awss3.CopyObject` server-side when endpoint+region match, else streaming `GetObject → manager.Uploader.PutObject`). Per-object manifest CAS via `meta.Store.SetObjectStorage` with pre-CAS sanity check on the live chunk locator; CAS losers (old chunks on success, new on reject) routed to GC via `meta.EnqueueChunkDeletion`. Safety rails refuse moves into `draining` clusters (new `cluster_state` row backed by meta + admin API `POST /admin/v1/clusters/{id}/drain|undrain` + 30s-TTL in-process `placement.DrainCache` invalidated on flip) and (RADOS only) into clusters above 90% fill via optional `data.ClusterStatsProbe` capability that runs `MonCommand({"prefix":"df"})`; refusals bump `strata_rebalance_refused_total{reason,target}`. Metric family `strata_rebalance_planned_moves_total` / `_bytes_moved_total{from,to}` / `_chunks_moved_total{from,to,bucket}` / `_cas_conflicts_total{bucket}` / `_refused_total{reason,target}`; trace shapes `worker.rebalance.tick` / `rebalance.scan_bucket` / `rebalance.move_chunk`. `data.BackendRef.Cluster` populated at PutChunks time so the rebalance scan can emit a single virtual move per S3 object. Operator runbook: [Placement + rebalance](docs/site/content/best-practices/placement-rebalance.md). Operator workflow `register → set Placement → drain old → rebalance → deregister` is now zero-downtime. (commit `97d4984`)
- ~~**P3 — Pools table shows class routing config, not actual cluster distribution.**~~ — **Done.** Shipped via the `ralph/drain-lifecycle` cycle (US-001). `internal/data/rados/health.go::DataHealth` + `internal/data/s3/health.go::DataHealth` rewritten to iterate `(cluster, distinct-pool)` matrix instead of `class → spec.Cluster`. The Pools table now returns `#clusters × #distinct-pools` rows (e.g. 2 clusters × 3 pools = 6 rows in the multi-cluster lab) with per-cluster `BytesUsed` populated independently per cluster via `ClusterStatsProbe.GetPoolStats(pool)`. Memory backend keeps the single `Cluster=""` synthetic row. Multi-class-per-pool aggregates to a comma-joined sorted class label, matching the memory + S3 convention. Operators can now see the true per-cluster footprint that drives drain decisions. (commit `9bb1b36`)
- ~~**P3 — Drain strict mode for PUT routing fallback.**~~ — **Done.** Shipped via the `ralph/drain-lifecycle` cycle (US-002 + US-004). New env `STRATA_DRAIN_STRICT` (default `off`, accepts `on`/`off`/boolean strings; unknown → fail-fast at boot) plumbed into `internal/data/rados/Config` + `internal/data/s3/Config`. When `on`, RADOS + S3 `Backend.PutChunks` refuse to fall back to a draining cluster (`data.ErrDrainRefused` carrying the resolved cluster id) — gateway maps the sentinel to HTTP `503 ServiceUnavailable` with `<Code>DrainRefused</Code>` body + `Retry-After: 300` header. **PUT only** — reads, deletes, HEAD, multipart Complete/Abort, List against draining clusters all keep working (drain semantic is stop-write, not stop-read). Counter `strata_putchunks_refused_total{reason="drain_strict",cluster}` increments per refusal. `GET /admin/v1/clusters` surfaces the boot-time value as a top-level `drain_strict: bool` field; the operator console renders a "strict" chip per cluster card so the global flag is visible without a separate fetch. Companion drain-lifecycle UX (US-003..US-006): `GET /admin/v1/clusters/{id}/drain-progress` reads the rebalance worker's in-process `ProgressTracker` (chunks_on_cluster + base + ETA + deregister_ready); `<DrainProgressBar>` + green "Ready to deregister" chip; per-tick completion detection logs INFO `drain complete`, writes a `drain.complete` audit row, bumps `strata_drain_complete_total{cluster}`, and best-effort fans `s3:Drain:Complete` through `STRATA_NOTIFY_TARGETS`. Pre-drain bucket-impact preview via `GET /admin/v1/clusters/{id}/bucket-references` + `<BucketReferencesDrawer>` + amber "All clusters in this policy are draining" chip on Bucket Placement tab. Operator runbook: [Placement + rebalance — Drain lifecycle](docs/site/content/best-practices/placement-rebalance.md#drain-lifecycle). Smoke walkthrough: `scripts/smoke-drain-lifecycle.sh` (driven by `make smoke-drain-lifecycle` against the `multi-cluster` compose profile). (commit `9bb1b36`) *Follow-up:* `STRATA_DRAIN_STRICT` env removed in `ralph/drain-transparency` (commit `7dd9b68`) — drain is now unconditionally strict; the `drain_strict` admin field, the "strict" UI chip, and the `reason="drain_strict"` counter label were retired alongside the env. See the new P3 *Drain transparency + drain/evacuate split* entry above.
- **P2 — Content-addressed object deduplication.** Today every chunk gets a fresh random OID even when two objects share identical bytes — duplicate uploads waste full-copy storage. Fix scope: chunk OID = `dedup/<sha256(content)>`; new `chunk_refcount` table in `meta.Store` keyed on OID; PUT path hashes the chunk, checks refcount, increments + skips RADOS write if the blob exists, else writes + sets refcount=1; DELETE / lifecycle-expire decrements; GC only deletes the underlying RADOS blob when refcount hits 0. Edge cases: (a) SSE-S3 / KMS — same plaintext encrypts differently per-object DEK, so dedup is incompatible with default SSE unless the operator opts into `dedup-friendly` mode where the DEK is derived from `hash(plaintext)` (weakens crypto independence; flag explicitly in `docs/sse.md` so operators understand the tradeoff); (b) hash hot-path cost — ~500 MB/s per core sha256 is acceptable; (c) cross-class dedup is opt-in (separate pools per class still mean separate storage even for same content); (d) manifest schema unchanged — chunk references stay `{Pool, OID, Length}` whether OID is random or content-addressed.
- ~~**P2 — Bucket / user quotas + usage-based billing.**~~ — **Done.** Shipped via the `ralph/bucket-quotas-billing` cycle (US-001..US-011). Per-bucket `BucketQuota{MaxBytes, MaxObjects, MaxBytesPerObject}` + per-user `UserQuota{MaxBuckets, TotalMaxBytes}` persisted across all three meta backends (memory + Cassandra + TiKV) via shared `internal/meta/quota.go` JSON codec. Live `bucket_stats{bucket_id, used_bytes, used_objects}` updated atomically on every PUT / DELETE / multipart-Complete (memory mutex / Cassandra LWT-CAS loop / TiKV pessimistic txn) and read at PUT-validate time by `internal/s3api/quota.go::checkQuota` — overage rejects with `403 QuotaExceeded` (RGW shape). Drift correction via leader-elected `--workers=quota-reconcile` (env `STRATA_QUOTA_RECONCILE_INTERVAL` default 6h, gauge `strata_quota_reconcile_drift_bytes{bucket}`); nightly aggregation via leader-elected `--workers=usage-rollup` writes one `usage_aggregates` row per `(bucket_id, storage_class, day)` (envs `STRATA_USAGE_ROLLUP_AT` default `00:00`, `STRATA_USAGE_ROLLUP_INTERVAL` default 24h) — single-sample `byte_seconds × 24h` v1 approximation, continuous-integration is a P3 follow-up. Admin API surface (`GET/PUT/DELETE /admin/v1/buckets/{name}/quota` + `/iam/users/{user}/quota` + per-bucket / per-user usage history) wired into `internal/adminapi/openapi.yaml`. Web UI: per-bucket Usage tab on BucketDetail + new `/iam/users/:userName/billing` page with cross-bucket breakdown + Edit Quota dialogs. Operator guide: [Quotas + billing](docs/site/content/best-practices/quotas-billing.md). Out of scope this cycle (kept on roadmap as P3 follow-ups below): invoice ledger / payment integration; continuous-integration `byte_seconds`; denormalised `user_bucket_count`. (commit `f2973db`)
- **P3 — Continuous-integration `byte_seconds` for usage rollup.** v1 single-sample approximation: rollup samples `bucket_stats` once per day and writes `byte_seconds = used_bytes × 86400`. A bucket that grows from 0 → 1 TiB at 12:00 UTC bills as if it had 1 TiB all day (over-states by 12 TiB·s). Fix scope: per-bump emit a `(bucket_id, storage_class, ts, used_bytes)` event the rollup integrates over the day; OR sample at higher cadence and trapezoid-integrate. Acceptable bounded error → low priority unless billing accuracy becomes a tenant ask.
- **P3 — Denormalised `user_bucket_count` for `UserQuota.TotalMaxBytes` checks.** PUT-validate fans out via `ListBuckets(owner)` to sum `bucket_stats` across the user's buckets — O(buckets-owned) on every write. Cheap for typical workloads; pathological at high bucket-fan-out per user. Fix shape: maintain `user_stats{user, used_bytes, used_objects, bucket_count}` updated atomically alongside `bucket_stats` and `CreateBucket` / `DeleteBucket`. Mirrors the bucket-stats pattern and lifts the user-scope check to O(1).
- ~~**P2 — Parallel chunk upload in `PutChunks`.**~~ — **Done.** Shipped via the `ralph/parallel-chunks` cycle (US-001). Bounded errgroup worker pool dispatches RADOS chunk writes concurrently while a single dispatcher goroutine owns the byte-stream MD5 hasher; manifest order + ETag (MD5 of source bytes) preserved regardless of completion order. Knob `STRATA_RADOS_PUT_CONCURRENCY` (default 32, range `[1, 256]`) read at `rados.Backend` constructor. Scheduler lives in tag-free `internal/data/rados/parallel.go` (librados-free unit tests). Multi-cluster manifests (US-044) handled automatically — worker resolves per-chunk ioctx via existing `b.ioctx(...)`. (commit `7d341f9`)
- ~~**P2 — Parallel chunk read / prefetch in `GetChunks`.**~~ — **Done.** Shipped via the `ralph/parallel-chunks` cycle (US-002). Bounded-depth prefetch reader fetches up to `STRATA_RADOS_GET_PREFETCH` chunks in flight while the caller drains the current chunk; default depth 4 (16 MiB inflight memory budget per request), range `[1, 64]`. Memory-bounded via semaphore + per-chunk size-1 future channel — peak buffered-but-unconsumed bytes ≤ depth × chunk_size. Range-GET (`offset`, `length`) still short-reads first/last chunks. Close cancels in-flight fetches and waits for goroutines within 500 ms (no leak — verified by `runtime.NumGoroutine()` baseline test). Scheduler lives in tag-free `internal/data/rados/prefetch.go` (librados-free unit tests). Bench harness `BenchmarkGetChunks_*_Prefetch` shows 3.7×–4.5× wall-clock speedup at 5 ms per-OSD latency; numbers in [Parallel chunk PUT + GET]({{< ref "/architecture/benchmarks/parallel-chunks" >}}). (commit `7d341f9`)
- **P3 — Erasure-code aware manifests.** For EC pools, track k+m parameters in the
  manifest for restore-path optimizations and accurate space accounting.
- **P3 — `ReadOp` / `WriteOp` batching in RADOS.** Bundle the head xattr read with the
  first chunk read in one OSD op (single round-trip for small objects).
- **P3 — Connection pool tuning.** Benchmark one `*rados.Conn` vs several for write-heavy
  workloads; measure CGO contention inside librados.

## Web UI

- ~~**P2 — Web UI — Foundation (Phase 1).**~~ **Done.** Embedded React+TS console served at `/console/` on the gateway port (`go:embed` + SPA fallback). Versioned `/admin/v1/*` JSON API + OpenAPI 3.1 spec at `internal/adminapi/openapi.yaml`. Session-cookie auth (HS256 JWT, 24 h, `HttpOnly`+`SameSite=Strict`+`Path=/admin`) backed by the existing static-credentials store, with SigV4 fallback for programmatic clients. Pages: login, cluster overview (CockroachDB-shape hero + nodes table + top-buckets + top-consumers widgets), buckets list (search/sort/paginate), bucket detail (read-only object browser with folder navigation + object detail panel), metrics dashboard (request rate / latency p50/p95/p99 / error rate / bytes — 15m/1h/6h/24h/7d ranges). Heartbeat infra in `internal/heartbeat` (memory + Cassandra; 10 s write, 30 s TTL). TanStack Query 5 polling (5 s default, per-range overrides on Metrics). Recharts 2 lazy-loaded. Bundle ≤500 KiB gzipped initial. Critical-path Playwright e2e (`web/e2e/critical-path.spec.ts`) running in CI under the `e2e-ui` job. Operator guide at `docs/site/content/best-practices/web-ui.md`. (commit `e27cf21`)
- ~~**P3 — Web UI — Phase 2 (admin).**~~ — **Done.** 22 stories: bucket admin (create / delete with force-empty job / versioning + object-lock toggle / lifecycle / CORS / policy / ACL / inventory / access-log), IAM users + access keys + managed policies (attach/detach), object upload (per-part presigned + Web Worker progress) / delete / tags / retention / legal-hold, multipart watchdog (cluster-wide list + bulk abort), audit-log viewer, settings (JWT secret rotation + S3-backend config + BackendPresign toggle). Playwright e2e: `web/e2e/admin.spec.ts` covers the five Phase 2 critical paths. `docs/site/content/best-practices/web-ui.md` capability matrix lists all 20 admin surfaces. (commit `5a6058b`)
- ~~**P3 — Web UI — Phase 3 (debug).**~~ — **Done.** 15 stories: SSE audit-tail (broadcaster + live-tail page with virtualised list, pause/resume, reconnect backoff), slow-queries (`total_time_ms` audit column + `ListSlowQueries` across memory/cassandra/tikv + filter/histogram UI), OTel trace ring buffer (in-process bytes-budgeted LRU with per-trace span cap, ringbuf-served via `/admin/v1/diagnostics/trace/{requestID}`) + waterfall renderer (depth-first bar layout, span detail sheet, recent-trace history, optional Jaeger deep link), hot-buckets heatmap (PromQL `sum by (bucket) (rate(...))` + custom canvas heatmap component, no @nivo dep), hot-shards heatmap (`strata_cassandra_lwt_conflicts_total{bucket,shard}` instrumentation + per-bucket tab with s3-backend explainer + drill panel), per-node drilldown drawer (5 PromQL sparklines via `instance="<addr>"` filter), bucket-shard distribution (per-shard sampler in `bucketstats` + Distribution tab with skew detection), replication-lag chart (`strata_replication_queue_age_seconds{bucket}` gauge + Replication tab gated on `replication_configured`). Playwright e2e `web/e2e/debug.spec.ts` covers five Phase 3 critical paths. `docs/site/content/best-practices/web-ui.md` capability matrix lists the eight new debug surfaces. (commit `7677cdd`)
- **P2 — Trace browser has no list view.** `internal/otel/ringbuf.RingBuffer` exposes `GetByRequestID` / `GetByTraceID` only — no `List(limit) []TraceSummary`. The UI's "Recent traces" panel reads from `localStorage`, populated only when the operator successfully opens a trace by id. Without an id, the page is search-only — operators can't discover what's in the ringbuf. Fix scope: add `RingBuffer.List(limit, offset)` returning the LRU front-N as `{request_id, trace_id, root_name, started_at, duration_ms, status}` summaries; expose via `GET /admin/v1/diagnostics/traces?limit=50`; render in the existing TraceBrowser page above the search box (sortable by start time, click → load full trace by request_id).
- ~~**P2 — TiKV meta backend emits no trace spans.**~~ — **Done.** `internal/meta/tikv/observer.go` wraps every public `Store` method with `Observer.Start(ctx, op, table)` returning a `finish(err)` closure that emits `meta.tikv.<table>.<op>` client-kind child spans (attrs `db.system=tikv`, `db.tikv.table`, `db.operation`, `strata.component=gateway`). `tikv.Config.Tracer` is wired by `internal/serverapp.buildMetaStore` via `tp.Tracer("strata.meta.tikv")`. Failing ops flip span status to Error so the tail-sampler exports regardless of `STRATA_OTEL_SAMPLE_RATIO`. Operator filter recipes live at `docs/site/content/best-practices/tracing.md`. (commit `2ccd209`)
- ~~**P3 — S3-over-S3 data backend emits no trace spans.**~~ — **Done.** `internal/data/s3/observer.go::installOTelMiddleware` registers the upstream `go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/otelaws` middleware (v0.68, semconv v1.40) at `connFor` BEFORE the metrics instrumentation, so otelaws Initialize-after brackets the full retry loop and emits one client-kind `S3.<Operation>` span per SDK call with `rpc.system.name=aws-api` / `rpc.method=S3/<op>` / `aws.region` / `http.response.status_code` attrs; a custom `AttributeBuilder` stamps `strata.component=gateway` + `strata.s3_cluster=<id>`. `cfg.Tracer = tp.Tracer("strata.data.s3")` wired in `internal/serverapp.buildDataBackend::case "s3"`. (commit `2ccd209`)
- **P3 — OTel ring-buffer eviction tuning under burst load.** The 4 MiB default + per-trace 256-span cap was sized by hand. Run a burst-load harness (`hey -z 60s -c 100 …` against `make run-memory` with ringbuf=on) and measure (a) eviction rate, (b) p99 trace retention age, (c) memory ceiling vs configured budget. Document the observed cap and either bump the default or expose `STRATA_OTEL_RINGBUF_BYTES` more prominently in `docs/site/content/best-practices/web-ui.md`.
- ~~**P3 — Web UI — TiKV heartbeat backend.**~~ — **Done.** `internal/meta/tikv/heartbeat.go` implements `heartbeat.Store` against the TiKV transactional client. Rows live under `s/hb/<nodeID>` with a JSON payload carrying `ExpiresAt = LastHeartbeat + DefaultTTL`; readers lazy-skip expired rows and writers eager-delete up to 16 expired rows per write so the prefix does not leak disk. Wired in `internal/serverapp.buildHeartbeatStore`. (commit `c37487b`)
- ~~**P3 — Heartbeat `leader_for` chip wired to actual lease state.**~~ — **Done.** `cmd/strata/workers.Supervisor` now exposes a buffered (cap 8) `LeaderEvents()` channel emitting `(workerName, acquired)` on every per-worker lease acquire/release; `internal/heartbeat.Heartbeater.SetLeaderFor(worker, owned)` mutates `Node.LeaderFor` under a mutex and the next write tick (~10 s) propagates to the cluster_nodes row consumed by Cluster Overview. `internal/serverapp.Run` wires a goroutine from `Supervisor.LeaderEvents()` into `hb.SetLeaderFor`. (commit `6f81734`)
- ~~**P3 — Multi-replica lab (TiKV).**~~ — **Done.** New `lab-tikv` compose profile spins up two TiKV-backed Strata replicas (`strata-tikv-a`, `strata-tikv-b`) behind an `nginx` LB at host port 9999, sharing a JWT secret via the `strata-jwt-shared` named volume (file-based atomic bootstrap via POSIX `O_EXCL`). `Supervisor.LeaderEvents()` → `Heartbeater.SetLeaderFor` propagates lease rotation into the Cluster Overview `leader_for` chip within ~35 s of a holder kill. `scripts/multi-replica-smoke.sh` (target `make smoke-lab-tikv`) drives 5 host-side scenarios; `web/e2e/multi-replica.spec.ts` mirrors the same in a `[multi-replica]`-gated CI job (`e2e-ui-multi-replica`). Operator guide at `docs/site/content/deploy/multi-replica.md`. (commit `9e36975`)
- ~~**P3 — Web UI — Storage status (meta + data backend observability).**~~ — **Done.** New `/storage` page (Meta + Data tabs + per-class card), Cluster Overview "Storage" hero card, and top-level `<StorageDegradedBanner>` above the AppShell. Backed by `meta.HealthProbe` (Cassandra `system.peers`+`system.local` merge with 10 s in-process cache; TiKV bootstrap-only `pdclient` against `/pd/api/v1/stores`; memory single-row), `data.HealthProbe` (RADOS `(*IOContext).GetPoolStats()` + `(*Conn).MonCommand({"prefix":"status"})`; S3-over-S3 `HeadBucket`; memory RSS proxy), and the `bucketstats` sampler extended with optional `ClassSink`+`Snapshot` for cluster-wide per-(class) totals (cardinality bound by `STRATA_BUCKETSTATS_TOPN`; cadence via new `STRATA_BUCKETSTATS_INTERVAL`). New endpoints `/admin/v1/storage/{meta,data,classes,health}`; aggregate `/health` honors `STRATA_STORAGE_HEALTH_OVERRIDE` for e2e. Playwright spec `web/e2e/storage.spec.ts` exercises page render, hero chip, and degraded-banner dismissal. Operator guide at `docs/site/content/architecture/storage.md`. (commit `cde5581`)
- ~~**P3 — Drain transparency + drain/evacuate split (always-strict).**~~ — **Done.** Shipped via the `ralph/drain-transparency` cycle (US-001..US-008). 4-state machine `{live, draining_readonly, evacuating, removed}` with mode picker on `POST /drain {mode:"readonly"|"evacuate"}` (no default — 400 if missing); 4-state transitions enforced server-side with 409 `InvalidTransition` payload. Worker scan categorizes chunks (`MigratableChunks` / `StuckSinglePolicyChunks` / `StuckNoPolicyChunks` + per-(cluster, bucket) `ByBucket` breakdown) and runs ONLY when `state=evacuating`; `draining_readonly` keeps stop-write semantics with no migration scan. New `GET /admin/v1/clusters/{id}/drain-impact` pre-evacuate analysis returns categorized counters + per-bucket `suggested_policies[]` (uniform-live + per-live-single-target); paginated, 5-min in-process cache. `<ConfirmDrainModal>` redesigned with radio mode picker + impact analysis on evacuate flip + amber stuck-warning panel that blocks submit while `stuck>0`; new `<BulkPlacementFixDialog>` lets the operator fix N affected buckets in one workflow (per-bucket suggestion picker + "Apply uniform to all" toggle, intersection-of-labels). `<DrainProgressBar>` rewritten — readonly renders a single orange stop-writes chip with Upgrade/Undrain buttons; evacuate renders a red label + three categorized counters + clickable stuck cells opening `<StuckBucketsDrawer>` + ETA (migratable-only) + deregister-ready emerald chip on `total_chunks=0`. Always-strict refactor: `STRATA_DRAIN_STRICT` env retired (legacy values log one WARN at boot and are ignored); `drain_strict` field on `/clusters` + "strict" UI chip removed; counter relabeled to `strata_putchunks_refused_total{reason="drain_refused",cluster}` (breaking dashboard change). In-flight multipart graceful contract preserved by the existing handle shape (`cluster\x00bucket\x00key\x00uploadID`) — UploadPart / Complete / Abort decode the cluster directly and never re-consult the picker. Smoke + Playwright: `scripts/smoke-drain-transparency.sh` (`make smoke-drain-transparency`) drives three scenarios end-to-end against the `multi-cluster` lab (A: stop-writes drain + in-flight multipart graceful, B: full evacuate with impact analysis + bulk-fix, C: upgrade readonly→evacuate); `web/e2e/drain-transparency.spec.ts` mirrors the UI half. Operator runbook rewritten at [Placement + rebalance — Drain lifecycle]({{< ref "/best-practices/placement-rebalance#drain-lifecycle" >}}). (commit `7dd9b68`)
- ~~**P3 — Web UI — Placement + cluster surfacing.**~~ — **Done.** Shipped via the `ralph/placement-ui` cycle (US-001..US-006). `data.PoolStatus` carries `Cluster string` end-to-end (RADOS + S3 + memory); Storage page Data tab renders a `<ClustersSubsection>` (one `<Card>` per registered cluster with id + state badge + backend chip + aggregated `bytes_used`) above the Pools table, which gained a Cluster column with empty-last sort. Each cluster card carries a `<ConfirmDrainModal>` typed-confirmation Drain button (mirrors `DeleteBucketDialog` — exact case-sensitive match arms submit) and a one-click Undrain. New BucketDetail Placement tab between Access Log and Hot Shards renders one row per registered cluster (slider + paired numeric `<Input>` two-way bound, draining clusters carry a `(draining)` chip but stay editable) wired to `PUT/DELETE /admin/v1/buckets/{name}/placement` with a confirmation Dialog on Reset. AppShell-level `<PlacementDrainBanner>` polls the shared `clusters` TanStack key (dedup with `<ClustersSubsection>` and `<BucketPlacementTab>`), renders only when ≥1 cluster is `state=draining`, and supports per-session dismissal stamped on `localStorage` keyed to the sorted draining-id set (new cluster entering draining → stamp differs → banner returns). New `GET /admin/v1/clusters/{id}/rebalance-progress` admin handler `fmt.Sprintf`s per-cluster PromQL (`sum(strata_rebalance_chunks_moved_total{to="<id>"})` + `sum(strata_rebalance_refused_total{target="<id>"})` + a 1h/1m rate range) and graceful-degrades to `metrics_available=false` on Prom-unset or upstream error; the per-card `<RebalanceProgressChip>` renders `"N chunks moved · M refused"` + an inline Recharts sparkline (h-6, no new chart libs) and silently degrades to `"(metrics unavailable)"` instead of toasting on transient Prom blips. Playwright spec `web/e2e/placement.spec.ts` exercises the full operator flow (login → /storage cluster cards → create bucket → slider save → typed-confirmation Drain → banner → Undrain → Reset to default) by spoofing the spoof-friendly admin endpoints via `page.route()` so the in-memory gateway is sufficient. Operator runbook gained a [Web UI section](docs/site/content/best-practices/placement-rebalance.md#web-ui); the console capability matrix at `docs/site/content/best-practices/web-ui.md` lists the four new surfaces. (commit `32804ba`)

## S3 API surface

- **P3 — Intelligent-Tiering.** Access-time tracking + auto-transition. Needs hot/cold
  access counters per object.
- **P3 — Select / Select Object Content.** SQL over CSV/JSON/Parquet in place. Large
  effort for narrow win.
- **(out of scope) — Object Lambda.** Storage layer should not host user code.

## Developer experience

- **P3 — Module tags cleanup.** `github.com/ceph/go-ceph` is in `go.mod` regardless of
  `-tags ceph`. A `go mod tidy` without the tag removes it, breaking reproducibility. Fix
  by wrapping the import in a default-on tag file, or pinning it as an explicit `require`.
- **P3 — `make dev` for one-command developer cluster.** Single command that bootstraps
  Cassandra + Ceph + the consolidated `strata` binary and streams logs.
- **P3 — Architecture decision records.** Move the design notes captured below into
  `docs/adr/` once external contributions start.
- ~~**P2 — Full project documentation site (GitHub Pages).**~~ — **Done.** Hugo site under `docs/site/` (CockroachDB-shape sectioned tree: landing, Get Started, Deploy, Architecture, Best Practices, S3 Compatibility, Reference, Developers), `make docs-serve` / `make docs-build`, GitHub Action `.github/workflows/docs.yml` publishes to `gh-pages` on every merge to main, README banner links to `https://danchupin.github.io/strata/`. (commit `c497a66`)
- **P3 — OpenAPI viewer (Redoc / Swagger UI) embedded in the API reference section.** `internal/adminapi/openapi.yaml` is the canonical Admin-API contract; today the docs site has no rendered viewer. Embed Redoc (or Swagger UI) under `docs/site/content/reference/admin-api.md` so operators can browse + try-out admin endpoints inline. Pulls from the YAML at build time so drift is impossible.
- **P3 — Helm chart packaging for Kubernetes deployment.** `deploy/k8s/` ships apply-tested example manifests (Deployment + Service + ConfigMap + Secret + Ingress); operators wanting templated values + chart releases must wrap them by hand. Author a `deploy/helm/strata/` chart with `values.yaml` covering replicas / image / env / resources / ingress / TLS, wire `helm lint` into CI, document `helm install strata deploy/helm/strata/ -n strata` as the alternate flow alongside the raw manifests in `docs/site/content/deploy/kubernetes.md`.
- **P3 — Reference section expansion (env vars table, Admin API surface, S3 API operations table).** `docs/site/content/reference/_index.md` is a placeholder. Author three reference pages: every `STRATA_*` env var with default + range + cross-link to the consuming layer; full Admin API surface (mirrors / cross-links the OpenAPI viewer once that lands); S3 API operations table mapping every supported S3 operation to its handler + ROADMAP entry. Source-of-truth grep against `internal/...` so the table stays drift-proof.

## Alternative metadata backends

Strata supports two production metadata backends: **Cassandra** (with **ScyllaDB** as a
CQL-compatible drop-in — zero code changes, gocql works unchanged, CI matrix landed in
US-042) and **TiKV** (raw KV via `tikv/client-go`, native ordered range scans short-circuit
Cassandra's 64-way fan-out via the optional `meta.RangeScanStore` interface; ships with
`docs/site/content/architecture/backends/tikv.md`, `docs/site/content/architecture/benchmarks/meta-backend-comparison.md`, and
`.github/workflows/ci-tikv.yml`). Both are first-class — the core team benchmarks,
documents, and maintains both paths. Memory is for tests only.

Headline gap from `docs/site/content/architecture/benchmarks/meta-backend-comparison.md`: TiKV's native ordered
range scan finishes a 100k-object `ListObjects` in **30–50 ms** vs Cassandra's
64-way fan-out + heap-merge at **150–300 ms** — **~5× faster** on the listing hot path.
LWT-equivalent operations (`CreateBucket`, `CompleteMultipartUpload`) are ~1.5–2× faster
on TiKV pessimistic-txn vs Cassandra Paxos; small-object Get hot paths
(`GetObject`, `GetIAMAccessKey`) are dominated by network RTT and look comparable.
Cassandra wins on audit retention (`USING TTL` is free; TiKV runs an explicit
sweeper).

The `meta.Store` interface stays intentionally minimal (LWT semantics, clustering-order
reads, range scans). Capability-specific features (e.g. native range scans across
partitions) land behind **optional interfaces** that a backend opts into:

```go
// In internal/meta. Optional, not required by Store.
type RangeScanStore interface {
    Store
    ScanRange(ctx, bucketID, start, end string, limit int) (*ListResult, error)
}
```

Gateway code uses type-assertion (`if rs, ok := store.(RangeScanStore); ok {...}`) to
pick the better code path when available, falling back to the fan-out/heap-merge default
otherwise. TiKV implements `RangeScanStore`; Cassandra explicitly does not (the fan-out
path is the only shape Cassandra serves efficiently).

Non-goals:
- A backend that cannot honor at least `LOCAL_QUORUM`-equivalent semantics. Single-node-
  consistent-only stores (Redis standalone, SQLite) will never be a supported production
  path.
- Backends that cannot represent the `(bucket_id, shard, key, version_id DESC)` clustering
  natively. Anything slower than O(page_size) per page on `ListObjects` is not acceptable.

## Known latent bugs

- GET with `Range: bytes=start-` where `start >= size` returns `416` — same as AWS.
  `Range: bytes=-N` with `N > size` returns full body — matches AWS. Edge cases around
  zero-length objects: not tested.
- Streaming chunked decoder assumes `\r\n` strictly and reads via `bufio`. Does not handle
  `aws-chunked-trailer` (newer aws-cli variants). aws-cli 2.22 observed to use plain
  `x-amz-content-sha256: <hex>` for `s3api put-object` and STREAMING for `s3 cp`, both
  tested working.
- Lifecycle worker has no retry on transient failures — next tick re-tries.
- **`TestThreeReplicaDistribution` is flaky.** `internal/lifecycle/distribute_test.go:111`
  seeds 9 buckets with random UUIDs and asserts each of 3 replicas processes 1..5 buckets
  via `bucketReplicaIndex(bucket.ID, 3)`. With 9 random UUIDs the FNV-32a distribution can
  legitimately produce 6/3/0 or 6/2/1 splits — observed flake rate ~30 % under `-count=20`.
  The flake reproduces on `main` independent of US-003 changes. Fix: either seed UUIDs from
  a fixed PRNG so the split is deterministic, or relax the guard to `0..6` (the test still
  pins the `totalDeletes == buckets` invariant a few lines above, which is the real
  correctness signal).
- **`gc.Worker.drainCount` infinite-loops when `Data.Delete` fails persistently.**
  `internal/gc/worker.go:123-126` logs the warn + returns `nil` from the goroutine
  *without* ack'ing the entry; the outer `for {}` loop re-issues `ListGCEntries`
  and gets the same batch back. Any non-retryable error (RADOS ENOENT for an OID
  already swept by a sibling leader, pool not found, mis-routed cluster id) wedges
  the worker on a single batch forever. Surfaced by the Phase 1 bench harness
  (`strata-admin bench-gc` against the real `strata.rgw.buckets.data` pool with
  synthetic OIDs). Fix: ack on ENOENT (the chunk is already gone — that's the
  terminal state) and on any non-retryable RADOS error class. Out of scope for
  the gc-lifecycle-scale Phase 1 cycle; bench numbers in `docs/site/content/architecture/benchmarks/gc-lifecycle.md`
  were captured against `STRATA_DATA_BACKEND=memory` to bypass the spin.

## Design notes captured during MVP and "modern complete"

Documented in `memory/project_strata.md` (internal) and in commit messages. A few that
deserve a dedicated `docs/adr/` entry:

- Why we skip RADOS omap entirely (the thing RGW uses and we are replacing).
- Why `IsLatest` is derived at read-time from clustering order, not flipped on every PUT.
- Why `go-ceph.NewConnWithUser("admin")` takes the short ID, not `client.admin`.
- Why the runtime image is based on `quay.io/ceph/ceph:v19.2.3` (matching librados version,
  multi-arch) instead of stock debian librados (stale at v16).
- Why `data.Manifest` lives in a JSON-encoded blob column instead of normalised columns —
  schema-additive evolution without `ALTER`.
- Why each background worker is leader-elected separately rather than co-locating them in
  a single supervisor (and why that choice is being reconsidered — see Consolidation
  section above).
- Why the protobuf manifest (US-048/049) ships behind a decoder-first migration: every
  reader handles both shapes for one full release before the writer flips.
